# ARShaderLab

`ARShaderLab` is a simple skeleton project for rapidly creating, testing, and learning about shaders in ARKit and SceneKit.

![Demo](media/shader_demo.gif)

The demo uses two simple shaders:
- `surface.shader` is a simple surface shader modifier that scrolls the UV and shifts the color in a sinewavey plasma
- `geom.shader` is a geometry shader modifier that will bend the sphere according to sine/cosine waves shifted over time
